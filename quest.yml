title: Observability
description: If a system falls in the forest, does it make a sound? Yes, yes it does, and so do engineers when their systems fail—and these sounds are strikingly similar! The one thing that’s even worse than dealing with a failing system is not knowing that your system is failing. That’s why in this quest, you’ll add monitoring capabilities to your project by setting up observability tools and alerts.
summary: Nice job! You should now have a little more confidence in our app and in your ability to fix things when they will (and they will break, we promise ;) ). Now that you see how easy it is to configure a monitoring system, you should make a habit of doing it at the beginning of every production deployment.
slogan: Gaining visibility through data.
